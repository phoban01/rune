## Problem Statement: Secure and Efficient Secret Management in Kubernetes

Managing secrets in a Kubernetes environment can be a challenging task. Traditional approaches often involve manual handling of sensitive information, leading to potential security vulnerabilities, operational inefficiencies, and difficulties in maintaining secret integrity across various applications and microservices. Furthermore, securely retrieving and decrypting secrets while ensuring proper access control and authentication can add complexity to the overall system.

## Introduction: Rune - Secure and Seamless Secret Retrieval for Kubernetes

Rune is an open-source solution designed to address the challenges of secret management in Kubernetes environments. It provides a secure and seamless approach to retrieving, decrypting, and utilizing secrets while ensuring strong access control and authentication mechanisms.

Rune integrates with Kubernetes and leverages Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define secrets and their associated metadata. With Rune, secrets are stored in a secure manner, and their retrieval is facilitated through a well-defined workflow. The service employs encryption technologies, such as Tink, to ensure the confidentiality of secret data during transmission and storage.

### Key Features

- **Secure Secret Retrieval**: Rune securely retrieves secrets from specified sources, leveraging SPIRE for authentication and access control.
- **Efficient Decryption**: Utilizing the powerful Tink encryption library, Rune efficiently decrypts secrets, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.
- **Seamless Integration**: Rune seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes, allowing the creation of Kubernetes secrets based on the retrieved secret data.
- **CLI Convenience**: The Rune CLI client provides a user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the Rune service, simplifying secret management tasks.
- **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Rune is built with flexibility and extensibility in mind, allowing for the integration of custom key management systems and secret sources.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Rune is accompanied by comprehensive documentation, providing clear guidelines and examples for easy adoption and usage.
